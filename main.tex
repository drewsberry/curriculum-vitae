\section{Employment and Experience}

\vspace{2pt}

{\large\textbf{NERC Internship}, \textit{University of Bristol, Earth Sciences
(2014)}, Aerial Photogrammetry}

I worked in an interdisciplinary team based in the School of Earth Sciences
(funded by the Natural Environmental Research Council) on the practical
application of aerial photogrammetry using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This summer
project involved practical problem solving with Physicists, Geographers and
Volcanologists, working cutting edge photogrammetry and UAV autopilot software.
This required a formal write-up and presentation, giving me further experience
presenting my work to a group of peers.

\vspace{1em}

{\large\textbf{Utrecht Summer School}, \textit{Utrecht University (2014)}, Theoretical
Physics}

I attended the Utrecht summer school in theoretical physics, an intensive two
week course of mathematical, physical and computational study. {{ Extra couple
of words }}

\vspace{1em}

{\large\textbf{Skillsets}, \textit{University of Bristol (2013-2014)}}

I participated in a university program to build business, leadership and
teamwork skills for physicists. This consisted of \textit{Strategies for
Success}, a competitive business simulation, and \textit{Eureka}, in which I
worked collaboratively to successfully develop a business plan to capitalise on
a scientific patent.

\vspace{1em}

{\large\textbf{Summer Internship}, \textit{University of Bristol, Particle
Physics Group (2013)}, Psi Decays}

I worked with LHCb researchers on simulations of $\psi(3770)$ decays using the
ROOT Object Oriented framework for C++. This allowed me to develop my technical
programming skills, gain an understanding of and actively experience research in
a fast-moving subject area, and gain experience producing final results to
deadlines and under pressure. I presented my findings to the particle physics
group, allowing me to develop my presentation skills.

{\large\textbf{Classroom Support}, \textit{Merchants Academy (2013--present)}}

I provide classroom support for Mathematics classes in a local school on a
weekly basis as part of the `Students in Schools' program. Here I help school
students achieve their potential and develop their mathematical skills. This has
allowed me to use my interpersonal skills and develop my ability to build
rapport in order to engage students and enable them to achieve at the highest of
their capability.

\vspace{1em}

{\large\textbf{Open Day Steward}, \textit{University of Bristol (2012 \& 2013)}
}

I guided potential university applicants around the university, answering any
queries or questions and helping them with their decision-making process. I also
engaged their interest in the university, physics and the research being
undertaken, presenting a positive image of the university.
